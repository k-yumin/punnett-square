# punnett_square
The [**Punnett square**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punnett_square) is a square diagram that is used to predict the genotypes of a particular cross or breeding experiment.

## how does it work
1. This script first prompts you to input number of crosses.
2. It generates all possible allele combinations (gametes).
3. And writes them to an Excel file.

### options
- You can color Excel cells that have the same phenotypes.
- You can also calculate the phenotypic ratio.
