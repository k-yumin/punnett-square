# punnett_square
The [**Punnett square**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punnett_square) is a square diagram that is used to predict the genotypes of a particular cross or breeding experiment.

## how does it work
1. This script first prompts you to input number of crosses.
2. It generates all possible allele combinations (gametes).
3. It fills in this DataFrame with all possible combinations of these gametes.
4. It writes this DataFrame to an Excel file.

### option
- You can color Excel cells that have the same phenotypes.
- Or, you can also calculate the phenotypic ratio.
